v102
(xx/11/15)

Images:
All DietPi images have been updated to v101.

Odroid infomation:
Odroid C1/XU4 | The DietPi images are now based on the excellent Odrobian (Debian 8/Jessie) by XeoSal. http://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=114&t=16520 . Why Debian? First, its more streamline and lightweight when compared to Ubuntu. Second, it reduces my coding workload from 3 distros to 2, as Ubuntu has different packages/filepaths/requirments that required additional coding. Third, Odrobian is the only Debian image i know of that has fully working Kernel/modules/drivers.
The Ubuntu 14.04 images for Odroid XU4/C1 are no longer supported by DietPi.

Software Additions:
DietPi-Software (Odroids C1/XU4) | Kodi is now available for Odroid C1 and XU4. All thanks to Odrobian and mdrjr for their repo used during installation.
DietPi-Software (Odroids C1/XU4) | DietPi optimized LXDE desktop is now available. Vastly improved C1 (no longer uses FBturbo driver)
DietPi-Software (Odroids C1/XU4, OPi) | DietPi optimized Weaved installation is now available.
DietPi-Software (Odroids C1/XU4) | DietPi optimized MiniDLNA installation option is now available.

Changes / Improvements / Optimizations:
DietPi-Config (OPi) | You can now update the Kernel and Firmware for your OrangePi. This will run Loboris kernel update script: https://github.com/loboris/OrangePi-BuildLinux/blob/master/update_kernel.sh
DietPi-Config > Advanced > Swapfile size | When the user changes the swapfile size, the new swapfile and its size will now be generated at the same time. Previously this was completed during boot.
General | Removed one of the reboots during first run filesystem expansion. This will speed up the inital setup of your system. Available for all DietPi images v101 or higher.
DietPi-Software | PHP now sets upload_max_filesize and php_max_post_size to 2GB. This will increase the max filesize limit with php uploads (eg: Owncloud). Previously 20~MB.
DietPi-Software | PHP now sets upload_tmp_dir to /var/tmp/php_upload_tmp. This was previously stored on /tmp as ramdisk, which limited php uploads (eg: Owncloud) to half your total RAM, causing possible failed uploads.
DietPi-Software (Jessie) | PHP will also install and optimize APCu along side Opcache (APCu is data store, OPcache is opcode cache). This should vastly improve webserver performance.
DietPi-Software | Enabled Deluged logging with level warning to /var/log/deluged.log and /var/log/deluge-web.log

Bug fixes:
Modules (OPi) | Resolved issues with invisible modules by updating the kernel / firmware to latest (provided by Loboris). https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/115
General (Jessie) | Resolved an issue where SystemD would throw warnings on /dev/tty1 regarding duplicate fstab entries. USB mounts are now disabled by default in fstab on new images. DietPi will enable one of the mounts as required during "1st run USB drive" setup.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v101
(14/11/15)

Changes:
DietPi-Software | Enabled minidlna installation option for Orange Pi and VMware.
DietPi-Software | Modified the installation method of phpBB3 forums. No longer uses apt installation. Downloads and sets up the phpbb.zip.
DietPi-Config > AutoBoot options | Added "Console: Automatic Login" option. Useful for custom projects that require autologin on main terminal (tty1), without launching a specific program.
DietPi-Config (RPi) > Audio options > Soundcard | You can now select "none" as your soundcard. This will disable the snd-bcm2835 kernel module, saving memory and resources.
DietPi-Config (OPi PC) | Changed 3.5mm asound.conf to use plug rather than direct hw.
DietPi-Software  (OPi PC) | Installing HiFi will now default to 3.5mm output and unmute it, regardless of default device used in asound.conf.

Bug fixes:
DietPi-Ramlog | Resolved an issue where "Full" and "None" logging modes, would clear logfile contents during boot. https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/112
DietPi-Apt-get_Update | Resolved an issue where the state file would stay at 0 (which believes apt-get is running), causing endless waiting.
DietPi-Software (RPi Jessie) | Resolved an issue where Kodi would install using packages from deb.multimedia, rather than Raspbian. This was due to FFMPEG installation which requires the additional repo. After installing FFMPEG, the deb.multimedia repo will now be removed. https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/111
DietPi-Software  (OPi PC) | Resolved broken volume controls for HiFi (mpd+ympd) using 3.5mm output.
DietPi-External_drive_setup (RPi) | When setting up a dedicated external drive, rootdelay=10 will be added to cmdline.txt. This should prevent slow powering external drives, from failing to be ready and mountable during boot.
