v102
(03/12/15)

Important DietPi Changes:
All DietPi images have been updated to v102 and are required to run the latest version of DietPi. Previous images will no longer update, and are no longer supported.
Passwords | All passwords throughout DietPi are now dietpi (previously raspberry). This includes everything with a password (eg: dietpi-software installations).
DietPi for Odroid C1/XU4 has changed to Debian Jessie | The DietPi images are now based on the excellent Debian Jessie images by Meveric http://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=96&t=17542&p=114970#p114970. Why Debian? First, its more streamline and lightweight when compared to Ubuntu. Second, it reduces my coding workload from 3 distros to 2, as Ubuntu has different packages/filepaths/requirments that required additional coding and testing.

New Features:
DietPi-Launcher | Menu system that allows you to run any of the DietPi programs, all from one place.
DietPi-Cron | Menu system that allows you to change the cron start times: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/118#issuecomment-161051801

DietPi-Software | PHP now sets upload_max_filesize and php_max_post_size to 2GB. This will increase the max filesize limit with php uploads (eg: Owncloud). Previously 20~MB.
DietPi-Software | PHP now sets upload_tmp_dir to /var/tmp/php_upload_tmp. This was previously stored on /tmp as ramdisk, which limited php uploads (eg: Owncloud) to half your total RAM, causing possible failed uploads.
DietPi-Software (Jessie) | PHP will also install and optimize APCu along side Opcache (APCu is data store, OPcache is opcode cache). This should vastly improve webserver performance.
DietPi-Software | HAproxy will now install v1.6.2.
DietPi-Software | Deluge-web no longer requires a service restart by the user during 1st run.
DietPi-Software | Enabled Deluged logging with level warning to /var/log/deluged.log and /var/log/deluge-web.log

DietPi-Config > Performance > Overclocking | Tweaked the RPi 1/2 overclocking settings to improve stability. These are settings I personally use across all my RPi devices during testing, and, should be stable for all.
DietPi-Config > Advanced > Swapfile size | When the user changes the swapfile size, the new swapfile and its size will now be generated at the same time. Previously this was completed during boot.
DietPi-Config > Advanced > Swapfile size | Can now also be disabled.
DietPi-Config (OPi) | You can now update the Kernel and Firmware for your OrangePi. This will run Loboris kernel update script: https://github.com/loboris/OrangePi-BuildLinux/blob/master/update_kernel.sh
General | /etc/apt/sources.list is now unified across all DietPi Jessie images (excluding Raspbian), using the global Debian mirror: http://ftp.debian.org/debian
General | All firmware and kernel have been updated to latest.

Bug fixes:
DietPi-Update | Some users were experiencing wget failures due to SSL/cert issue on GitHub, or local network setup. This was causing the 1st run update and installation to fail. The script has been updated to use curl which does not fail. https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/125
Kernel Modules (OPi) | Resolved issues with invisible modules by updating the kernel / firmware to latest (provided by Loboris). https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/115
General (Jessie) | Resolved an issue where SystemD would throw warnings on /dev/tty1 regarding duplicate fstab entries. USB mounts are now disabled by default in fstab on new images. DietPi will enable one of the mounts as required during "1st run USB drive" setup.
DietPi-Software (Odroid C1) | Resolved an issue with Kodi launching as black screen.

DietPi-Config (RPi) > Audio options > Soundcard | You can now select "none" as your soundcard. This will disable the snd-bcm2835 kernel module, saving memory and resources.
DietPi-Config (OPi PC) | Changed 3.5mm asound.conf to use plug rather than direct hw.
DietPi-Software  (OPi PC) | Installing HiFi will now default to 3.5mm output and unmute it, regardless of default device used in asound.conf.

Bug fixes:
DietPi-Ramlog | Resolved an issue where "Full" and "None" logging modes, would clear logfile contents during boot. https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/112
DietPi-Apt-get_Update | Resolved an issue where the state file would stay at 0 (which believes apt-get is running), causing endless waiting.
DietPi-Software (RPi Jessie) | Resolved an issue where Kodi would install using packages from deb.multimedia, rather than Raspbian. This was due to FFMPEG installation which requires the additional repo. After installing FFMPEG, the deb.multimedia repo will now be removed. https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/111
DietPi-Software  (OPi PC) | Resolved broken volume controls for HiFi (mpd+ympd) using 3.5mm output.
DietPi-External_drive_setup (RPi) | When setting up a dedicated external drive, rootdelay=10 will be added to cmdline.txt. This should prevent slow powering external drives, from failing to be ready and mountable during boot.

DietPi-Software | Added DietPi optimized installation option for Wordpress (Blog and publishing website).
DietPi-Software (RPi-Jessie) | Added DietPi optimized installation option for Kodi.

Changes:
General | Sudo is now installed by default on all DietPi images. As most online guides for linux software uses Sudo in their documentation, and scripts, this allows us to bridge the gap to less experienced linux users by preventing "command not found".
LXDE (Desktop) | Updated desktop and menu items to include dietpi-nice.
DietPi-Software | SoftEther VPN server will now install the latest version.
DietPi-Software | RetroPie has been removed as a DietPi optimized installation option. The installation cannot be truly automated and requires user input from the RetroPie setup script. Users will need to install RetroPie from following their online documentation.

Bug fixes:
DietPi-Software (VMware) | Softether VPN server will now download and install the correct (64bit) package.
DietPi-Software | Resolved issue with PhpMyAdmin selection complaning of LAMP/LEMP not installed, when it is due to be installed by software that requires it.
