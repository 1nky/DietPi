# DietPi
Minimal Raspbian with optional optimized "ready to run" software.

#At its core, DietPi is the goto image for a minimal Rasbian Server install. 
We've stripped down and removed everything from the official Raspbian image to give us a bare minimal Raspbian server image that we call "DietPi-Core".
DietPi is a netinstall image, so no resources are wasted on unneeded software. 

#DietPi's easy to use, optional Installation Choices for popular software:
DietPi comes with popular optional install choices. All of which are pre-configured and "ready to run" with all the optimizations and configurations done for you. 
This ensures you get the maximum performance from your Pi and the software you choose to install.

As DietPi is built on Raspbian and with its various install choices, you wont be restricted to using a specific image release for one task.
Only the software you select will be installed with none of the bloatware found on the official Raspbian image.
- LXDE (Lightweight Desktop, without the bloatware found in Raspbian)
- Kodi / Xbmc
- Bittorrent Server (Transmission)
- OwnCloud Server
- Forums (phpbb3)
- Web Server (Apache2 + mysql + php5 + phpmyadmin)
- FTP server (Proftpd)
- Music Server Beta (Mopidy)
- Gaming (RetroPie)

If you choose to install nothing, you will be left with DietPi-Core (a bare minimal Raspbian server installation).
